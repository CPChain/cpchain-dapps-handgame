# What's RPS?

RPS (Rock-Paper-Scissors) is a simple battle game that can play on the blockchain. The gameplay is just like the rock-paper-scissors in the real world, players choose their own cards to battle with others. But this process all is in blockchain via a smart contract. So all processes can not cheat and modified.

# Security Trust Visibility

<!-- 与中心化对比  -->

Centralized | RPS
-----|------
Private data needs to be exposed, and there are security risks | Private data is stored locally
The server needs to be running，otherwise the game will not respond| Smart contract automatic execution
The server controls everything, data may be modified| Visibility and traceability

<!-- 1) Private content, you choose will not be known to anyone.
    玩家选择内容需要发送到中心化服务，更容易被别人获取
2) Automatic execution on the blockchain.
    服务器判断输赢
3) Undeniable. 获胜者直接获得奖励
    需要依赖服务器对获胜者进行奖励，服务器停止运行，即便获胜也无法得到奖励
